    "\n",
    "In this lab we will begin working the transcripts of the State of the Union addresses. These speeches are a grand tradition with historical significance in the United States. In this first lab, we will do some simple analysis to parse the addresses by breaking them up into sentences. We will then look at the trends in the data, and do a little detective work to understand how the addresses have evolved over the years. \n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of technical and programming content, this lab will continue some of the skills we began developing in previous labs, including regular expressions, string splitting, and so on. We will also briefly discuss the `json` data format, which is very commonly used for unstructured data like text. We'll also take a closer look at the supremely handy `print` function.\n",

    "Disclaimer: The addresses themselves are of course political events, and trigger political commentary. We'll focus on programming and the analysis of data rather than politics.\n",

Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and citizens of America: Tonight, as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of Black History Month, we are reminded of our Nation's path towards civil rights and the work that still remains to be done. Recent threats targeting Jewish community centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week's shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly forms. Each American generation passes the torch of truth, liberty, and justice in an unbroken chain, all the way down to the present. That torch is now in our hands, and we will use it to light up the world. I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart.\n",
